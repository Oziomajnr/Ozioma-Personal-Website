# My top 5 favorite software engineering podcasts



Podcasts have become a big part of my daily routine for the past 3 months. 
As a remote developer who does not get to be around co-workers regularly to discuss technology and developments,
Podcasts have served as an alternative source of information,
I get to learn about how engineers from top tech companies
tackle their technical challenges and developers find the motivation to push their project and careers. 

Here are my top 5 favorite podcasts.

1. [**Software Engineering Daily**](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com)
  This is by far my favorite, with at least an episode for every day of the week,
  you would think there would be a compromise in quality of the content of this podcast but that is not so.
  Software Engineering daily interviews Software Engineers and Tech Entrepreneurs and they talk about how they built 
  their products, company culture, etc. The preambles are usually very interesting too.
  
2. [**Software Engineering Radio**](https://www.se-radio.net) 
  Sponsored by IEEE, Software Engineering Radio interviews Software Professional where and tech experts where they
   get to share their ideas and advice on a wide range of topic, the content of this podcast is similar to
  Software Engineering Daily, even though Software Engineering radio might appear to be more professional and
   less frequent (about 3-4 episodes a month).
   
3. [**Talking Kotlin**](http://talkingkotlin.com)
    Talking Kotlin is a podcast that is a from Jet Brains where they talk about the advancement of the Kotlin Language,
    you learn how different teams are applying the Kotlin language in their platforms.
    If you are a Kotlin developer and you want to know how different people are using the Kotlin programming language,
    then you could check out this podcast. The host is funny too.
    
4. [**Fragmented Podcast**](https://fragmentedpodcast.com)
Fragmented Podcast is a podcast for Android developers, topics from this range from best practices in building android
applications, the Kotlin and Java programming language, sometimes they also get to interview some top android
developers from around the world. Episodes are less frequent these days though.

5. [**Free Code Camp**](https://podcast.freecodecamp.org)
If you're learning how to code or you need some motivating stories about how people living regular lives became
outstanding Software Engineers, then you would enjoy the free code camp podcast. Most of the time,
this podcast picks some interesting stories from free code camp blog and read it out, this is usually easier to consume
than reading a blog. They also interview some engineers too and they talk about how they were able to overcome
obstacles to become software engineers. 

Podcasts have an advantage over blogs and videos because you do not have to be visually engaged in it to consume
the content, so you can listen to podcasts while doing other things and it is something I have come to enjoy recently.
